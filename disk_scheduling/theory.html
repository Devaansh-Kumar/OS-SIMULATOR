  <h1>Disk Scheduling Theory 
  <a href="simulation.html"><button>Simulator</button></h1></a>
</br>
  <h2>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)</h2>
  <p>
    FCFS is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm where requests are served in the order they arrive.
    While it follows a fair order of serving requests based on arrival time, it may result in poor performance
    when requests are scattered across the disk. This can lead to increased seek time, as the head moves
    continuously from one request to the next without considering their proximity to the current head position.
  </p>

  <h2>SCAN</h2>
  <p>
    SCAN is an elevator algorithm that reduces the average seek time by continuously moving the head in one
    direction and servicing requests along the way. This provides a more efficient order of serving requests
    compared to FCFS. However, SCAN may cause increased waiting time for requests located in the opposite
    direction of head movement, as it does not consider their proximity to the current head position.
  </p>

  <h2>Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)</h2>
  <p>
    C-SCAN is a variant of the SCAN algorithm that aims to provide a more uniform distribution of waiting time
    for requests. Instead of reversing direction, the head jumps to the other end of the disk and starts
    servicing requests again. While it eliminates the increased waiting time for requests located between the
    head position and the start of the disk, it may result in increased waiting time for requests in the
    opposite direction.
  </p>

  <h2>LOOK</h2>
  <p>
    LOOK is an improvement over the SCAN algorithm, as it changes direction when there are no more requests in
    the current direction. This reduces the average seek time compared to SCAN, as it avoids unnecessary
    movement to the end of the disk. LOOK provides a more efficient distribution of waiting time for requests,
    considering their proximity to the current head position.
  </p>

  <h2>Circular LOOK (C-LOOK)</h2>
  <p>
    C-LOOK is a variant of the LOOK algorithm that provides a more uniform distribution of waiting time for
    requests. Similar to C-SCAN, the head jumps to the other end of the disk when there are no more requests
    in the current direction. C-LOOK eliminates the unnecessary movement to the end of the disk, resulting in
    improved performance compared to LOOK.
  </p>

  <h2>Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)</h2>
  <p>
    SSTF selects the request that is closest to the current head position, minimizing the seek time by choosing
    the shortest seek time for each request. It can result in a more optimal average seek time compared to other
    algorithms. However, SSTF may cause starvation for requests located further away from the current head
    position, as it always prioritizes the closest request.
